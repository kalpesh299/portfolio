     <p className='para'>
     Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Oktay and I'm from Berlin, Germany. As a Full-Stack software developer, I specialize in creating visually appealing websites, apps and mobile games. My passion for graphic design isn't just a hobby, it's a key ingredient in every project I work on.
     
     <span className='hiddentext'>
     In my free time, I enjoy exploring my other passions, such as photography and music production, which provide me with creative outlets. I am also very passionate about Web3 and everything related to crypto, NFTs and blockchain technology as I believe they have the potential to revolutionize business and online interactions.
     If you have an innovative idea for a project that needs to be developed, I would love to hear from you. Your vision can be turned into a real product. Don't hesitate to reach out and let's start a conversation about your concept. I'm excited to collaborate and help bring your ideas to life.
